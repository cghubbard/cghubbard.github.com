#### Research
Currently I work with Dr. Chinmay Hegde researching recommendation systems, matrix completion and GPU computing.  Recently we published a matrix completion framework [GPUFish](https://github.com/cghubbard/gpu-fish) that can solve matrix completion problems _lightning fast_ (approximately).  In the next few months we hope to adapt the GPUFish framework to a number of matrix completion techniques.  In addition to the working on GPUFish I have joined with a team of undergraduate students to build an app that recommends recipes to users based on their preferences.  Having spent most of the semester learning the basics of building an app we are almost ready to begin collecting recommendations.  Once we have enough recommendations GPUFish will be able to provide recommendations but, in the mean time, I am researching the most effective ways to make content-based recommendations.

Recently I have began working through a few self-paced classes on [dataquest](https://dataquest.io) with the goal of picking up any data science skills I may miss before graduating.  I am starting with a few Data Cleaning and Data Visualization lessons and hope to apply what I learn to a Kaggle data set in the near future.
