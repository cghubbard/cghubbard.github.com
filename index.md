My name is Charlie Hubbard and you've made your way to my blog.  Congrats! 

## About the Blog
This blog was created highlight my exploration of machine learning, recommendation systems and GPU computing as a graduate reserach assistant at Iowa State University.  While the blog is in its infancy I will mostly be posting about past projects and completed work.  Once I have caught up to my current research I will begin posting more broadly about data science as I work to build my own skill set.    

## About the Author
I am a second years masters student at Iowa State University in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a graduate research assistant under Dr. Chinmay Hegde.  With Dr. Hegde I study the application of GPU computing to machine learning and recommendation systems.  You can find links to my papers, presentations as well as more about me [here](/about)!
